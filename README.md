# MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-Classification-with-Neural-Networks
This project is a simple but powerful demonstration of how we can use deep learning to recognize handwritten digits. It‚Äôs built using the popular MNIST dataset, TensorFlow, and Keras. The idea is straightforward: train a neural network to understand what each digit (0 through 9) looks like, and then use it to classify new digit images ‚Äî including custom ones you upload.

üîç What This Project Does
- Loads the MNIST dataset, which contains thousands of handwritten digit images.

- Preprocesses the data (normalizes pixel values, visualizes images).

- Builds and trains a deep neural network using Keras.

- Tests the model‚Äôs accuracy using the test set.

- Lets you input your own image (like a PNG of a handwritten number) and predicts the digit.

üß† How the Model Works

The model is a feedforward neural network:

- It starts with a Flatten layer to convert the 28√ó28 image into a 784-length vector.

- Then it passes through two Dense layers with ReLU activation for learning patterns.

- Finally, a Dense output layer with 10 units predicts the digit (0‚Äì9).

It‚Äôs trained using the Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss, which are standard for classification problems.

üìä How Well It Performs

After training for just 10 epochs, the model reaches over 97% accuracy on the MNIST test set. We also plot a confusion matrix to see where the model is getting things right (or wrong), and visualize predictions.

‚ö° Real-World Applications 

While this project is built for learning, the core idea behind it ‚Äî digit recognition ‚Äî has real uses in industry, especially in electrical and electronics engineering:

- Automatic Meter Reading: Use image recognition to automatically read values from electric or water meters.

- Control Panel Monitoring: Read digits from displays in industrial panels remotely.

- Quality Control in Manufacturing: Check part numbers or instrument readings automatically.

- Legacy System Digitization: Convert analog gauge readings to digital data.

- Embedded & IoT Devices: Run lightweight models on microcontrollers to monitor or classify data in real-time.

So even though it starts as a simple deep learning exercise, this kind of model has real potential in the automation and monitoring tools used by electrical engineers every day.
